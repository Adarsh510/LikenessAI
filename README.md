# LikenessAI

LikenessAI is a project designed to determine similarity between two images of a person. Users can input an old image and a current image of an individual to assess whether they depict the same person. This tool leverages AI technology to analyze facial features and provide insights on resemblance, offering a practical application for identity verification and comparison.
